A complete port from JavaTV to Android of the Java TV API version 1.1.

The project includes a sample application which lists Service Information retrieved from a Java TV XML file. The port offers: Guide; Navigation; Selection; Transport; Service; Media; Receiver; Protocol; Codecs; and more utilities from the Java TV 1.1.

The sample app is also trying to fetch a video from a service, but the MediaSourceNode still need some work.

The project is opensource with GNU Lesser GPL License. Please, join me in making this a huge success!

See below a screen shot of the sample Android app which uses the EkhoTV API to load TV services:
