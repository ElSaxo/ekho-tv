# Introduction #

ekho-tv is a port of the JavaTV 1.1 API. Except for the Java Media Framework stack, it includes everything that JavaTV 1.1 has.

There is a sample application (i.e. EkhoTVSample) which uses the ekho-tv library and displays a list of Digital TV services.

# Details #

The ekho-tv project is configured as an Android Library Project, which means it's really straight forward to use.

It also depends on Action Bar Sherlock and Holo Everywhere projects.

The minimum Android SDK level is set to 10, which means the version 2.3.3 (Gingerbread).
