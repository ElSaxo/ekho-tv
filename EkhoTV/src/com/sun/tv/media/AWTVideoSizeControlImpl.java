/**
 * An interface that allows setting clipping, scaling, and translation of a
 * video stream in a simple, interoperable way. Not all possible combinations of
 * positioning will be supported, so this interface provides a mechanism to
 * discover how closely the underlying platform will approximate a request for
 * positioning.
 * <p>
 * All interactions via AWTVideoSizeControlImpl happen in the coordinate space
 * of the screen. For example, successfully setting the video's position to the
 * location reported by getLocationOnScreen() on the xlet's root container will
 * cause the upper-left hand corner of the video and the root container to
 * coincide.
 * <p>
 * The screen, in the context of AWT, is the area into which graphics drawing
 * operations are done. Its size is given by java.awt.Toolkit.getScreenSize(),
 * and locations reported by Component.getLocationOnScreen() are given in the
 * screen's coordinate system.
