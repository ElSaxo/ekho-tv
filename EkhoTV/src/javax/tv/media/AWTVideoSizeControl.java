/**
 * <code>AWTVideoSizeControl</code> allows setting clipping, scaling, and
 * translation of a video stream in a simple, interoperable way. Not all
 * possible combinations of positioning will be supported, so this interface
 * provides a mechanism to discover how closely the underlying platform will
 * approximate a request for positioning.
 * 
 * <p>
 * All interactions via AWTVideoSizeControl happen in the coordinate space of
 * the screen. For example, successfully setting the video's position to the
 * location reported by <code>Component.getLocationOnScreen()</code> on the
 * <code>Xlet</code>'s root container will cause the upper left-hand corner of
 * the video and the root container to coincide.
 * <p>
 * The screen, in the context of AWT, is the area into which graphics drawing
 * operations are done. Its size is given by java.awt.Toolkit.getScreenSize(),
 * and locations reported by Component.getLocationOnScreen() are given in the
 * screen's coordinate system.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Instances of <code>AWTVideoSizeControl</code> may be obtained from a JMF
 * <code>Player</code> via the methods <code>getControl(String)</code> and
 * <code>getControls()</code>. Note that a Java TV API implementation may not
 * always or ever support <code>AWTVideoSizeControl</code> for a given Player;
 * in such a case, the failure modes specified by the two aforementioned methods
 * will apply.
