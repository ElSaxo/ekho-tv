/**
 * <code>AlternativeContentEvent</code> is generated to indicate that
 * "alternative" content is being presented during the presentation of a
 * service. Alternative content is content not actually part of the requested
 * service, such as content related to conditional access failures (e.g.,
 * purchase dialogs or advertising for content for which the user is not yet
 * authorized). The presentation of alternative content is always initiated by
 * the system and never by applications.
 * <p>
 * 
 * This event will be generated in two situations:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>At the end of a successful service selection operation, this event will
 * be generated if any of the service components being presented are alternative
 * content. Under these conditions, the generation of this event signals a
 * change in state of the service context from the <em>presentation pending</em>
 * state to the <em>presenting</em> state. A <code>NormalContentEvent</code>
 * will not be generated.</li>
 * 
 * <li>
 * During the presentation of a service, this event will be generated if any of
 * the service components being presented are replaced by alternative content.
 * One example of this is the expiration of a free preview period. In this case,
 * generation of this event does not impact the service context state model.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Presentation failures enforced via a conditional access system may be
 * reported by this event or by a <code>SelectionFailedEvent</code> with the
 * <code>CA_REFUSAL</code> reason code. Which of these is used depends on the
 * precise nature of the conditional access system. Applications must allow for
 * both modes of failure.
 *
